This project implements a Gamma-code encoder using Finite State Machine (FSM) logic on an FPGA.
It converts input symbols from switches into LED blink patterns representing short (dot), medium (dash), and long (bar) pulses.
The system also displays the chosen symbol on a seven-segment display and includes modular testbenches for simulation.
